# Movie Trailer Website: Udacious Tomatoes

This was a short project for Udacity's Full-Stack Nanodegree sequence. It contains four files: 

* media.py, which defines class "Movie" to store related data including title, director, genre, release year, etc.
* movie_data.py, which defines a list "movies" containing six instances of the class "Movie" (instantiated in the same file) and calls the method "open_movies_page" to create an .html file displaying data, promotional art, and trailer links for each movie
* website.py, which contains methods to generate the output HTML
* udacious_tomatoes.html, which is the final piece of output generated by movie_data.py and website.py
